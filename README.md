## *This is a VBA / MS Access information site showing you how to use advanced VBA techniques to create a stable and modern experience in MS Access*

### We aren't trying to re-create the wheel here. There are age-old problems or hurdles that MS Access has that we believe we can help with.
We will not be posting articles for questions that already have good answers on many other sites - unless we feel we could package it in an easier-to-digest way.

### Our goal is to help you build:
 - a modern, secure, and stable MS Access Database that can act and feel as close to an actual modern application as possible.

### Maybe MS Access isn't the end-goal in your scenario. However, for many it becomes the only viable option due to how quickly a tiny team (or individual) can build an impressive system that can scale surprisingly well.
 It wasn't my end goal... Still sometimes I question whether I should leave it in the past or not. But here we are - *and because it simply meets most needs* - **we will probably not pursue other options for a long time.**
